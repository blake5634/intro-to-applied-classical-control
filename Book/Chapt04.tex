\section{Problem Statement and Learning Objectives}

Most of this course will cover control system design using system transfer functions (rational polynomials in $s$ which describe the input-output relationships of system blocks).  However when we write the equations of motion, it is an ideal time to introduce a couple of concepts from the ``modern control theory" introduced in the 1960's which has supplanted the $s$ domain methods in some applications.

\paragraph{Learning Objectives}
Be able to
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the basic system equations to represent a linear
    dynamic system in state space.
    \item Convert equations of motion (EOMs) into state space
    representation.
    \item Use the computer to plot step response and state trajectories from
    the state space model.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
In ``modern" control theory, the system is represented as a first order linear differential equation in a high dimensional space known as state space.  Each point in state space represents a unique dynamical state of the system.   For example, a system with one mass could be described by a 2-dimensional state space consisting of the position, $x$ and the velocity, $\dot{x}$ (Figure \ref{2Dstatespace}).

\end{figure}

One way to define the dimensionality of a system's state space is to identify all system variables which describe an energy.  Each one is a dimension of state space.   In our single mass example, energy is stored in the spring and mass:
\[
E_K = \frac{1}{2}(K_1 + K_2)x^2 \qquad E_M = \frac{1}{2}M{\dot{x}}^2
\]
So for this system we would use $x$ and $\dot{x}$ as state variables.
We use a vector, $X$, to define a point in state space such as:
\[
X = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \dot{x} \end{bmatrix}
\]
Then the dynamics of the system are represented in a matrix first order LODE:
\[
\dot{X} = AX+BU
\]
Where $X$ is the state vector, $\dot{X}$ is the first derivative of the state vector,
\[
\dot{X} = \begin{bmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \ddot{x} \end{bmatrix}
\]
$A$ is a matrix of constant coefficients,
$U$ is the system input (like an applied force, $f(t)$), and
$B$ is another matrix.  This form can represent systems with multiple inputs (the elements of $U$), but here we will restrict ourselves to a single input so only one element of $U$ is non-zero.

Sometimes the output of the system, $Y$, is not one of the state variables, but instead a linear
combination of the state variables and possibly the input.  In this case there is another equation
\[
Y = CX+DU
\]
where $C,D$ are additional matrices of constant coefficients.
There is no Laplace transform and the
equations come directly from the equations of motion. In many realistic systems,
many  elements of these matrices are zero.



\section{System Matrices from Equations of Motion}\label{SecSystemMatricesFromEOMs}
Let's see how EOMs turn into the State Space representation using the example system of Figure \ref{2Dstatespace}.  Writing the EOM:
\[
M\ddot{x}+B\dot{x}+(K_1+K_2)x = f(t)
\]
rearranging to solve for $\ddot{x}$:
\[
\ddot{x} = \frac{1}{M}\left[ -B\dot{x}-(K_1+K_2)x+f(t)\right ]
\]
\[
\ddot{x} = -\frac{B}{M}\dot{x} - \frac{K_1+K_2}{M}x + \frac{1}{M}f(t)
\]
Converting this to a matrix equation is just rearranging according to
\[
       \dot{X} = \begin{bmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \ddot{x} \end{bmatrix}
\qquad      X  = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \dot{x} \end{bmatrix}
\qquad U       = \begin{bmatrix}0\\f(t)\end{bmatrix}
\]
%  \begin{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}
then we have
\[
\dot{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \ddot{x} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\frac{-(K_1+K_2)}{M}&\frac{-B}{M}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x\\ \dot{x}\end{bmatrix}+
\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&\frac{1}{M}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}0\\f(t)\end{bmatrix}
\]
The top row is sort of a trivial equation, and the second row is the rearranged equation of motion.
This is the state space description for the system of Figure \ref{2Dstatespace}.


\begin{Example}\label{suspensionstatespace}
Consider the car suspension
Example 2.\ref{ExampleCarSuspension} and Example 2.\ref{ExampleCarSuspensionTF}.
\vspace{0.2in}
Derive the state space representation.

The EOMs were:
\begin{align*}
&M_w\ddot{x}_2+B_s(\dot{x}_2-\dot{x}_3)+K_s(x_2-x_3)+K_t(x_2-x_1) =0 \\
&M_v\ddot{x}_3+B_s(\dot{x}_3-\dot{x}_2)+K_s(x_3-x_2) = 0
\end{align*}
Note that the input to this system is $x_1$, the displacement of the road.  We  can
re-write the EOMS to put the input on the RHS:
\begin{align*}
&M_w\ddot{x}_2+B_s(\dot{x}_2-\dot{x}_3)+K_s(x_2-x_3)+K_tx_2 = K_tx_1 \\
&M_v\ddot{x}_3+B_s(\dot{x}_3-\dot{x}_2)+K_s(x_3-x_2) = 0
\end{align*}
Let the state vector be:
\[
X = \begin{bmatrix}x_2 & \dot{x}_2 & x_3 & \dot{x}_3\end{bmatrix}^T
\]
(where T indicates transpose to make $X$ a column vector)
and its derivative is
\[
\dot{X} = \begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}_2 & \ddot{x}_2 & \dot{x}_3 & \ddot{x}_3\end{bmatrix}^T
\]
Rearranging the EOMS:

\begin{align*}
\ddot{x}_2  &= \frac{1}{M_w}\left [-(K_T+K_s)x_2-B_s\dot{x}_2+K_sx_3+B_s\dot{x}_3\right]\quad+\quad \frac{1}{M_w}K_tx_1 \\
\ddot{x}_3 &= \frac{1}{M_v}\left[+K_sx_2+B_s\dot{x}_2 -K_sx_3-B_s\dot{x}_3\right]
\end{align*}

We then have the 4x4 matrix state equations:
\[
\dot{X} = \begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}_2 \\ \ddot{x}_2 \\ \dot{x}_3 \\ \ddot{x}_3\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} 0&1&0&0\\
-\frac{(K_T+K_s)}{M_w}&\frac{-B_s}{M_w}&\frac{K_s}{M_w}&\frac{B_s}{M_w}\\
0&0&0&1 \\
\frac{K_s}{M_v}&\frac{B_s}{M_v}&\frac{-K_s}{M_v}&\frac{-B_s}{M_v}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_2\\\dot{x}_2\\x_3\\\dot{x}_3 \end{bmatrix}+
\begin{bmatrix}
    0&0&0&0&\\
    0&\frac{K_t}{M_w}&0&0&\\
    0&0&0&0&\\
    0&0&0&0&\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\x_1\\0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}
\]
Note that we have two trivial equations: rows 1 and 3:
\[
\dot{x}_2 = \dot{x}_2 \qquad \dot{x}_3 = \dot{x}_3
\]
Once your parameter values are known, you can plug them in and it is easy to evaluate the response to any input using the computer.
\end{Example}

%
% To see that there are infinitely many SS representations of a linear system, consider a
% rotation matrix such as
% \[
% R = \begin{bmatrix}1 & \cos{\theta} \\ -\sin{\theta} & 1\end{bmatrix}
% \]
% (such a matrix is called ``orthonormal" and has eigenvalues of unit magnitude).   The key point
% is that multiplying a matrix by a rotation matrix does not change its eigenvalues at all.   Therefore,
% if $R$ is orthonormal we can write
% \[
% RY = RAX+RBU
% \]
% and we have a new system matrix  $RA$ which represents the same system as $A$.
